A script that builds a simple camera rig that has aim controls built into it.

INSTALLATION:
- Save the folder this file is in to your maya/scripts directory.
- Drag and drop CameraRig_INSTALL.py into your Maya viewport.
- A button should be created in your "custom" shelf.

Pressing the newly added button should build the rig.
The controls in the rig are visible through the camera, but they hide themselves during playback.
If I can find a way around this I'll be sure to add it.
