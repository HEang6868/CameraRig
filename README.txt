A script that builds a simple camera rig that has aim controls built into it.

INSTALLATION:
- Save the folder this file is in to your maya/scripts directory.
- Drag and drop CameraRig_INSTALL.py into your Maya viewport.
- A button should be created in your "custom" shelf.

Pressing the newly added button should build the rig.

Pink World Ctrl: Gives the rig an "origin". Controls the initial orientation, position, and scale of the rig.
Green Main Ctrl: Controls the camera like normal. Has a toggle for the visibility of the Aim Ctrls.
Yellow Aim Ctrls: Function like a regular Maya "camera and aim" setup. Move the camera with the yellow tear drop and control where it's pointed and how it's tilted with the sphere.

The controls in the rig are visible through the camera, but they hide themselves during playback.
If I can find a way around this I'll be sure to add it.
